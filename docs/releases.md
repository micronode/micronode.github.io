# Software Releases

The mantra at the heart of Open Source is "Release early, release often", which demands innovative approaches
to release cycles.

## Versioning

TBD.

## Release Frequency

A recommended starting goal for any Open Source projects is to aim to release a new version at least once
per month. Setting a regular cadence for releases is important to gain the trust of the Open Source
community, as irregular release cycles, or long delays between releases can lead to questions around the
longevity of the project.
