Technology has infiltrated every aspect of our lives, however future generations will increasingly push these technologies to the edges.

## Valuing the field of view

The rapid adoption of technology is both exciting and engaging, however it could be argued that technology is consuming too much of our attention in its current form. It is not uncommon to see the majority of commuters with their nose firmly planted in their mobile phone, oblivious to the surrounding environment. Ultimately we will need to disengage from technologies that hijack our entire field of view, supplanted with other technologies that can realise the same benefits using more subtle techniques.

# Ahead of the adoption curve

There is no doubt that certain industries and sub-cultures adopt technology advances more quickly that the general population. Notably, the IT industry is widely known to be at the forefront of technology adoption, partly due to such advances being directly related to Information Technologies. As such, the push towards less-visible technologies must come from the software industry, where the evolution of processes and practices will influence wider society as a whole.

## Less is more

The one overriding mantra to making technology invisible is that less is more. Through removing wasteful processes and practices, reducing clutter in software development, and hiding features that do not need to be visible, we reduce our dependence on technologies that we ultimately don't need.
