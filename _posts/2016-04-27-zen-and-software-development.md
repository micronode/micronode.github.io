# Zen and Softare Development

All aspects of the software industry are trending towards more robust, resilient and reliable practices, ironically through a process of 'letting go'.

## Infrastructure

The DevOps movement was born from the frustrations of maintaining brittle and error-prone environments, that just took too much time and effort to maintain. Through using descriptive and unambiguous configurations infrastracture can be tailored, optimised and reproduced on demand to support the specific needs of the application software.

## Release Cycles

The long tail of traditional release processes requires a disproportional amount of time and effort compared to the increasingly automated and repeatable processes used in the development of application software. Naturally these traditional practices are being displaced by the adoption of similarly automated and repeatable processes, known collectively as Continuous Deployment. Not only does Continuous deployment reduce the effort and time required to maintain production software, but it has additional benefits such as getting new features and fixes into production quicker.

## Continous Improvement

Frameworks have long been at the disposal of software developers, which both encourage a specific approach to application architecture and support the simplification of feature development through reusable code. The disadvantages associated with frameworks however are many: developers become lazy in their style and approach, due to handing off responsibility for the code to these frameworks. A lack of understanding of the underlying frameworks means that developers are more inclined to just copy prior working examples without a focus on improving the codebase.
